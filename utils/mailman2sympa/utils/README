Mailman has a number of commands for manipulating lists and subscribers.
Contained here are three:

add_members
list_members
remove_members

If you use robots, as we do, list names require a little finessing,
which the latter two scripts have, but add_members does not (but could
if someone would like to improve it).

Add_members uses sympa's command-line options.  The other two scripts
go directly to the database.  Needless to say, that makes them a little
more fragile.
