Mailman Installation Guide
--------------------------


If you are able to read this file , you probably accomplished the main part of installation:

- Get mailman2sympa-<version>.tgz

- unpack the package: tar -xzvf mailman2sympa-<version>.tgz  

- enter the  mailman2sympa-<version> directory

Now you still have to configure mailman2sympa:

- edit conf/mailman2sympa.conf
  The file is well documented (I hope). Just follow instructions


And lauch the task:

./mailman2sympa.sh

After completion
----------------

- a directory is created under the $EXPL directory of sympa

- in each directory you can find a config file and a subscribers file.

- if you asked it, you will find all messages splited under the mhonarc archive directory. 
  You may now use the web interface, connect as listmaster (as specified in /etc/sympa.conf)
  go to "sympa admin" and ask for converting all lists to html. Click only once on the
  button, don't care about the error message (sympa 3.2.1). The process runs in the
  background, and may take a long time.

- you can add the file $WDIR/aliases-sympa at the bottom of /etc/aliases.
  If you chose to set a prefix, you don't still have to remove mailman lists aliases.
  Run "rewaliases".

- load the subscribers files into the database.
  You've got two options: loading subscribers from sympa list-subscriber-files (via
  'loadsubscribers_from_config.sh') or mailman2sympa-generated CSV-Files in WDIR (see
  'conf/mailman2sympa.conf')

- run 'upgrade_sympa_password.pl' from sympa-directory (usually in /sbin or /bin)


For 'mailman2sympa.sh' you can give as parameter a file name containing the names of the
lists to process. One name per line. By default, all lists of mailman are processed.

Example:
./mailman2sympa.sh restricted_liste


Enjoy!
